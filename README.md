# Finite State Machine

A simple Python implementation of a final state machine.

Will use some extra libs to handle operations with graphs and trees operations:

#Graphs

networkx: http://networkx.github.io/documentation/development/index.html

installing: sudo apt-get install python-networkx

#Trees

treelib: https://github.com/caesar0301/treelib

instaling: sudo easy_install -U treelib


This implementation have 3 main goals:

- Read finite state machines from a file
- Read a set of sequences from a file
- Verify if that the sequences (Test set) set is N-complete

#Usage

After install the required libs:

python main.py mef.txt seq.txt


Where:

- fsm.txt -> Is a file that contains the representation of the mef
- seq.txt -> A set of input to run in a FSM


This implementation is based in the following paper:
