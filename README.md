# Finite State Machine

A simple Python implementation of a final state machine.

This implementation have 3 main goals:

- Read finite state machines from files
- Read a list of sequences from files
- Verify that the sequences (Test set) set is NP-complete

This implementation is based in the following paper:

Adenilso Simao, Alexandre Petrenko: Checking Completeness of Tests for Finite State Machines.  IEEE Trans. Computers 59 (8): 1023Â­1032 (2010)
